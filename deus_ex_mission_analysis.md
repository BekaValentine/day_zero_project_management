# DX Mission Analysis

This analysis tries to capture the core parts of the DX missions and what their primary tensions are.

The overall pattern is that there's one extremely common kind of goals: Get to Location. This typically is for a purpose, so you can do something at the location, but once you're in the location, the doing isn't especially involved, usually just pressing a button or whatever.

There's also two extremely common kinds of challenges that you must overcome to achieve this goal:

1. The path to the goal is a NOGO zone with hostiles
2. The location of the destination is unknown

There are a number of subsidiary challenges that exist making the goal harder to achieve, such as locked doors, etc. but these are never actual blockers overall, just blockers for particular routes.

One useful trick that exists is to nest things, so that, for instance, to learn the location of X, you have to first achieve goal Y. It's not always necessary, but, if X is super well hidden, it's hard to discover the location without being told it.
