  - Telecom
  - Electrical
- Construction Worker
- Cleaner
- Courier
- Guard

## Creating Justifications

Access and presence depends on looking like you belong. This depends not just on how you look, but where it is you are, and what the situation is. The situation can be influenced by the player. Creating these problems can be a means of gaining access.

### Examples

- Elevator problems justify elevator techs
- Telecom problems justify telecom techs

## Absence and Distractions Obviate Justification

Distractions of all sorts remove the need to justify presence. If people don't know you're there, no one can get angry at you for being there! Even better if there's a natural time when no one is there at all.

### Examples

- Noise makers to distract patrolling security
- Fire alarms to evacuate a building
- After business hours

## Buildings and Player Access

Since social engineering and access to a space involves looking like you belong, keeping the player on a knifes edge of tension is important. How can that be done? It depends on context.

During business hours, office workers have access to offices, labs, etc., but inappropriate use of computers or filing cabinets etc. is questionable. Being in someones office is dubious. For technicians, being in an office is fine but use of things is not. After hours, technicians might be expected to be present, especially if security is aware ahead of time, or if there's a clear reason that they should be aware of.

Most offices don't have cameras for privacy reasons, and so being in an office doesn't have that risk. But the higher the security, the more likely it is for the office to be monitored, starting first with patrols, then motion sensors or heat sensors, and then cameras. Responses to sensor-detecting isn't instant and depends on a guard seeing you on sensors, and then coming to investigate. Cameras give clear evidence of someone being present but heat or motion sensors don't, so being seen on camera is riskier because the guard knows you're there for sure. Motion or heat sensors can have flukes so guards are merely verifying at first, and isn't as alert.

The time taken to get to your location gives you a window of opportunity to get stuff done and get out.

## Barks

Cameras and sensors are silent, but barks are important for managing the knifes edge! How can these two be meshed? Some ideas:

- Most barks are patrol barks
- Vocalizations
- Footsteps
- Door and elevator sounds
- Lights turning on

More things should bark, too! DX for instance has machines that bark -- bots of course, but also control panels, etc. Some of these make sense, others done, but they can be adapted, often. For instance, instead of security panels with blaring alarms, a message about being reported to security monitors is a bark.

## Remote security levels

0. None
1. Low (periodic patrols)
2. Medium (heat or motion sensors)
3. High (cameras)
4. Very High (bots)

## Single vs. Multi Guard

When just a single guard is present, security is lower. Multiple guards can increase security, especially if one is in a security office.

Bots can supplement guards, because they're cheaper than people, and thus act as a kind of intermediate between single and multi-guard.

## Dealing With Security

- Patrols can be avoided or knocked out, but knocking them out is not permanent and is a kind of detection that will escalate things
- Heat sensors, motion sensors, and cameras can be knocked offline, but this is detectable and might raise suspicious
- Heat sensors, motion sensors, and cameras can be spoofed and this is undetectable
- Guards can be distracted by investigating one place while you go somewhere else
- Saturation - Repeated alerts on heat and motion sensors that lead to no confirmed intrusions make guards treat the sensors as broken. This isn't true of cameras or patrols, tho.
- Bots can be disabled, but this draws attention of a person.
