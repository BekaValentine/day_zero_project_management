# Modelling Tasks

These are the objects that will need to be modelled.

There is some logic to some of this. Namely, we can determine what objects need to be modelled by thinking about places and activities and so forth, and thinking about what things are frequently there. You can also figure out things to model by looking at, e.g. Ikea, but that'll only give a subset of things that aren't especially equipment-like.

For furniture specifically, there are probably a few levels of style for each kind of thing. For instance, consider a chair. Chairs can be very basic or very complex, it can be fancy or simple. It's often contextual to the kind of chair, and the designer aesthetic involved. Poorer people wouldn't own big fancy designer chairs, while rich people wouldn't own cheap folding chairs.

Therefore each kind of furniture should probably have maybe 3 kinds of designs: 2 basic, and 1+ fancy. One basic design could be very modernist, another could be more traditional. Ikea should be a reference point.
